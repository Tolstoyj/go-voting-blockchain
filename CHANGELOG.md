## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-05

### üéâ Phase 1: Security & Authentication - MAJOR RELEASE

This release introduces enterprise-grade security features, JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

#### ‚ú® Added

**Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication system with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with admin and voter roles
- Admin authentication with secure password management
- Voter authentication using private key ownership verification
- Token refresh mechanism for seamless user experience
- Current user information endpoint (`/auth/me`)

**Security Enhancements**
- Sliding window rate limiting with multiple tiers:
  - Strict: 10 requests/minute (sensitive endpoints)
  - Moderate: 30 requests/minute (standard endpoints)
  - Generous: 100 requests/minute (public endpoints)
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Professional error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Request logging and monitoring system
- Cryptographic signature verification for vote authenticity
- Private key ownership verification for voter login

**Middleware System**
- Authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- Rate limiting middleware with configurable limits
- Error handling and recovery middleware
- Request logging middleware with structured logging
- CORS error handling middleware

**Testing & Quality Assurance**
- Comprehensive security test suite (`tests/security_test.go`)

### üöÄ Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users

1. **Authentication Required**: Most endpoints now require authentication
   - Register voters using `/register` endpoint
   - Login as admin using `/auth/login`
   - Login as voter using `/auth/voter-login`

2. **New Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   ```

3. **Updated API Calls**: Include JWT tokens in Authorization headers:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
   ```

4. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of new rate limits on endpoints

#### For Developers

1. **New Dependencies**: Added JWT and validation libraries
2. **Middleware**: New middleware system requires proper configuration
3. **Testing**: Run security tests with `go test ./tests/`
4. **Development**: Use `scripts/dev-setup.sh` for environment setup

### üìä Statistics

- **Files Added**: 16 new files
- **Lines Added**: 2,191 lines of code
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for security features
- **API Endpoints**: 18 total endpoints (8 new authentication endpoints)
